# Project Euler implemented in Rust
This repository stores all of my implementations of the project euler written in rust.
I am a rust beginner looking to learn and improve upon my rust skills, I think project euler is one of the best ways to learn rust since it uses a lot of math-driven programs which may help with future calculations I may do in rust in the future.
