# Project Euler implemented in Rust
This is my implementation of Project Euler in the Rust programming language.

I chose rust since it's a robust, memory-safe, blazing-fast, and statically-typed systems programming language.

I believe Rust is the future of systems programming languages will start to gradually replace C and C++

I have created this project as a fun way for me to learn rust and since it's hard for me, because I'm not a systems programmer, I added useful and insightful comments so beginners like me can learn by reading the code without much googling.
